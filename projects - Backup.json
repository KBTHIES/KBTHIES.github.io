      "Title": "Airships",
      "BodyContent": "One passion of mine since 2010 has been Minecraft. I find it's a neat medium for voxel modeling and leaves some room for the imagination. It's also cheaper than legos. I got to lead a team of like-minded builders making a hub world for a server we played on, and other than learning the ropes of project planning and managing a group of folks, I got to do a bit of concept work as well!<br><br>We went with a steampunk theme, and I really liked the idea of building airships! I enjoyed thinking about how an airship might function and how to represent those functions while constrained by Minecraft's palette of blocks. I also did a bit of worldbuilding, thinking about parts that might be standardized by my imaginary manufacturer, WDI, and making ships that were modified to fit different needs. If there's one thing I'm the happiest about, it's that all the layers and spaces bleed into each other vertically. It's not like there just a main level and then a level above or below that, but they just flow nicely and moving through them in-game felt claustrophobic but fluid, which I imagine would fit the constraints of a vessel that needs to keep itself in the air. I've added interactive views of each one below! You can use your mouse to navigate around the models or click on the annotations to view specific areas that I marked, from things like the rudder to the helm!<br>\n<hr>\n<b>WDI Archon</b><br>\nThe Archon was my first airship design. that I made before working on the build mentioned above, so you could say it was basically my prototype. I designed it as a military/anti-piracy vessel, so the hull's been reinforced with dark brown armor plates and plenty of mounted weapons. Additionally, the hold has been hollowed out to make room for a deployable strike craft ornithopter.<br><br>\n    <iframe width=\"690\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/a4364e48fd594eff982a2a4ee8d67708/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowvr=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" onmousewheel=\"\"></iframe><hr>\n<b>WDI Leviathan</b><br>\nThe Leviathan was my second airship, this time designed as a merchant vessel built off of the same frame as the Archon, and I imagine that the Archon was just a militarized version of the Leviathan rather than the other way around. It features a larger hold and landing skids, and felt a lot more open than the Archon's armored walkways.<br><br>\n<iframe width=\"690\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/c705fe53e2c34de3940760434e66684b/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowvr=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" onmousewheel=\"\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<b>Penzance's Plunder</b><br>\nThe Penzance's Plunder I designed as a pirate vessel, and it's sleeker profile and two large propellers instead of one drive prop and two steering props show that the vessel was designed for speed, what might have once been a racing vessel converted to blockade running. It's been armed but not armored, with a large anti-aircraft gun in the front being its main armament and grappling ballistas being on each side to aid in boarding activities. I also didn't imagine the pirates would be docking it often, so it features a ladder that can drop down for boarding.<br><br>\n    <iframe width=\"690\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/06ba56072c2f423895ddbe381a1abff6/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowvr=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" onmousewheel=\"\"></iframe><hr>\n<b>WDI Life Boat</b><br>\nThe WDI Life Boat was the largest airship I built, and served an actual purpose for the server being a venue for so-called \"drop parties\" where people would drop free items while the rest of the server ran around on the deck below trying to pick up free and often valuable goodies. With this in mind, I was going for the look of a pleasure craft but building around the large main deck. With that in mind, it has many indoor and outdoor observation decks, with some fully enclosed by glass to help get out of the choppy winds outdoors. For a ship as large as it is, it features extra propulsion with the engines from the Penzance's Plunder being relegated to merely steering propellers. As seemed fitting to a party vessel, the main balloon was instead turned into colorful smaller balloons, not just to resemble party balloons but to have redundancy in case there were to be damage.<br><br>\n    <iframe width=\"690\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/820cc3c290964831b4c5607838ded2ba/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowvr=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" onmousewheel=\"\"></iframe>",

      "Title": "Arches",
      "BodyContent": "Arches were the final result of what was called the Tool Project. We started by being assigned a simple hand tool and we had to become really familiar with it. We drafted it, studied and drew its movement, and imagined how the section cut of the tool would change in the motions of being used. After that , we were paired up with another student and merged our motions to create a form.<br><br>My tool was a tortilla press, and my partner's tool was a knife sharpener. The end model had elements reflecting the hinging over time and the heaviness of the tortilla press, but also elements of repetition and cutting from the knife sharpener. The model in its many iterations focused on light and space, with two spaces under a shared roof divided by cutting vertical slats.<br><br>The big takeaway from this project was working with another individual on a high-stakes project. While the Building Study project had us working together in a group of three, this project was working on something original, and I think we made the mistake of not playing to each other's strengths. Vincent is a great designer and my specialty is in the fabrication, but I think in trying to find compromise we ended up with something neither of us was too happy with.<br><br>That being said, I do appreciate the drawings I made as part of this project, and I also pushed my renders to a higher level than before. On a previous iteration of my portfolio website, I actually used these renders as the header and footer of the website, and I think the renders really leverage the strengths of the architecture.",

      "Title": "Saco Lake Bathhouse",
      "BodyContent": "This project was a wellness center that included pools for bathing accommodating both shallow and deep water, saunas, an area for yoga and meditation situated near Saco Lake, New Hampshire. The project demanded we be mindful of the interplay between the site and the bathhouse, as well as considering mindfulness and atmosphere.\n<br><br>\nI envisioned the heavily forested site could have unique play with the trees surrounding it, and could fade into the background by imitating the trees around it. To separate those coming to the bathhouse to utilize its facilities from those who just wanted to hike in and take in the view, I designed the structure to have two concentric staircases, one of which was accessible from the inside of the building while the other was accessible from outside. Hikers could access a lower observation deck while those who went through the changing rooms, baths, and saunas could access a rooftop observation deck, which also maintains the privacy of those utilizing the rooftop for meditation or yoga.\n<br><br>\nDuring this project, I tried experimenting with a different method of rendering with overlaid colors and gradients. It was a style I had seen utilized by Studio SHAFT in their Monogatari series for background shots and I liked how they turned out. Instead of focusing too hard on realism, I think they were able to emphasize the atmosphere I was going for. You enter into a dark and cramped space, you bathe in the dark and then enter into verticality, into the light. I also got to utilize digital fabrication, with one of the stairs being 3D printed, the other print unfortunately refusing to cooperate before the deadline. I also chopped my file up for laser cutting to great effect, especially with the site model.\n<br><br>\nI'm glad that I got to try a lot of new things in the project, and I'm still really happy with the way the site model, building drawings, and renders turned out! While the model itself still left room for improvement, I played an important role in me utilizing digital fabrication technologies more! I only wish tree supports had been common then, and it's surprising that nobody at university taught me about deburring tools until I learned machining.",

In this project, our group was assigned to get really familiar with an architectural precedent. Our group was assigned the Fredensborg Houses by Jorn Utzon. The project involved getting familiar with the buildings, knowing the measurements and ideas behind them, and finally culminated in a scale model of the buildings and site. Since the Fredensborg Houses are a housing project, the three of us focused on three houses on the east end of the site.<br><br>As a group we had to construct the site model and each of us made our own model of the house, although each individual made their own set of drafts. I had a lot of fun with the drafts, since it was very satisfying when all the lines intersected perfectly, which took a lot of trust in yourself and in the process. Plus, the heavy-weight Strathmore paper we used wasn't cheap, especially for a student.<br><br>However, the part that I found the most enjoyable was making the models. All you had was a cutting mat, an architect's scale, a straight edge metal rule and an Exacto blade, and you had to do all of your measurements twice before committing to the cut and gluing it all together. If I had done this later in architecture school I would have used a laser cutter, but in a way it was great having to learn how to do it by hand!<p>",

One side of the site had a road while the other faced Lake Erie. The program called for a place for the wedding to take place, room for the couple to get ready and then make their way to the stage, a location for a reception, and some parking and bathrooms.<br><br>\n\nThe deliverables for the project had many pieces. We needed sections and a hand-rendered plan fit to a 1/4\"=1' scale, as well as a scaled hand-rendered perspective. We also had digital renders, and finally, the scaled wooden model.<br><br>\n\nThe design itself took heavy inspiration from a theatrical stage, and the layout had a counter-clockwise circulation pattern. Spaces were meant to emphasize transition and threshold.<br><hr><br>What I really appreciated about this project was that it was the first studio project where we had to heavily engage with the architecture woodshop, and reflecting upon my work, the design itself might not have been all too compelling, but the experience I gained in assembling the site model was monumental! I took care to make sure all of my wooden pieces lined up just right and really put in the time at the woodshop. At that point, I wasn't great at making sure every piece was toleranced correctly, but to make sure everything slot together perfectly I underwent a trial by fire so to speak.<br><br>I also got to experiment more with my render settings, and for this project I tried out the Nvidia IRay plugin while most of my peers were still using the school's licensed version of VRay.<br><br>Admittedly, the grandest takeaway for this project was the rendered site plan. I framed that thing after the semester ended and it's been hanging above my bed ever since. I don't think I've ever been content with my ability to draw, but I went the extra mile to add in ambient occlusion and render the distinct textures of gravel paths and grass. If anything, it's one of the better projects I use to benchmark myself when I look back at my work years later!</p>",

      "BodyContent": "<p>This was my final Project for Creative Coding and I loved it a whole lot! I ended up going way overboard any my project ended up being almost a thousand lines of code when it was only supposed to be a couple hundred. And yes, I did get a 100 and some points of extra credit for the effort. Before I go too far though, <b>The game is fully playable if you scroll down below this block of text.</b><br><br>Now, onto the project details! One of the things we covered in our class was the idea of a Turtle, an object that would move around by moving forwards, backwards, and rotating, so its motions weren't dependent on the traditional X and Y grid. I already knew that this was perfect for having basic creatures that could move around, but it would also be perfect for something like a Magic Missile that would follow an arcing non-linear path to its target. I also liked fantasy settings, being very involved with my school's Tabletop Roleplaying games club that was mostly Dungeons & Dragons, and I liked dungeon crawling video games like The Binding of Isaac. I decided that would make for a fun challenge, and so this project was born!<br><br>To briefly go over the game itself, it’s a dungeon crawler. The player goes into randomly generated rooms with randomly generated enemies which make up floors of random length. As the player progresses through the floors, the average enemy speed and number in a room will gradually increase. Paired with the player’s health that only partially returns when a floor is completed, it’s certain that the player will die. The question then is how far can they make it?<br><br>To help me troubleshoot the project, I added in a ‘debug mode’ of sorts. By pressing ‘=’, the player can see a lot of cheaty data, spawn enemies, generate the final room of each floor, and increase how many floors the game thinks the player has cleared. There were a lot of challenges. I wasn’t sure how to do level generation (the system can easily do non-linear levels by generating more doors but linear is easy to play through) and for a while, enemy AI was giving me some problems.<br><br>In the end, I’m more than happy with what I made. I enjoy playing it, I enjoyed making it, and I enjoy changing some of the settings to make the game truly ridiculous. Also the visual assets are either made by me or heavily changed free assets</p>\n<a href=\"linkedScripts/DungeonCrawl.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Project Source Code</a>\n<iframe src='linkedScripts/DungeonCrawl.html' width='100%' height='500px' frameborder='0'></iframe>\n<blockquote><b>Controls</b><br>Movement - WASD or the Arrow Keys<br>Cast Magic Missile - Point and click with your mouse<br><br><b>Tips</b><br><ul><li>The glow on your staff indicates how much mana you have</li><li>If you’re shooting slowly, let up on the firing and just let it recharge</li><li>The magic missiles bank towards where your mouse is when you fire them</li><li>Aim slightly ahead of enemies for best results</li></ul><br><b>Debug Controls</b><br>Toggle Debug Mode - =<br>Increase Floor Number - SHIFT<br>Spawn enemy at cursor - E<br>Make next room the exit - ENTER</blockquote>",

      "BodyContent": "Pittsburgh has a lot of empty lots, with rowhouses frequently being broken up by staccato voids, ghosts of the buildings that once stood there. These gaps aren't dissimilar to the neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, with neighborhoods that share a border realistically taking a half hour or more to reach with the natural borders of cliffsides or the artificial boarders of busways. Our site was 7539 Susquehanna St in Pittsburgh which was a vacant lot in a food desert and the community had set up the Sankofa Village Community Garden. The goal of the Grow Center project was to develop the site and make a resource for the community.\n<br><br>\nI was interested in using the rowhouse as a unit, so I started by arraying and twisting that unit to get the overall form. The main greenhouse was just one of many spaces available for planting, and was optimized both for sunlight direction but also to be an eyecatcher on the corner of the lot to encourage visitors to engage with the grow center.\n<br><br>\nI really enjoyed getting to go out to the site, planning sustainable building systems, and researching the climate factors such as sun direction and temperatures and having to relate those to areas for growing plants. I also had my first experience with VR for this project, with my Google Cardboard from the Medieval Fantasy challenge arriving the morning of final review allowing the reviewers to experience some of the main spaces of the building in VR. I also made a flythrough gif of the space, although in hindsight the quality is pretty lacking but that's a product of my laptop at the time and the length it'd take to render individual frames. I was really satisfied with my model, and while it was small, I think it was a great representation of the building. My favorite detail, other than the wire trees, is that the doors in the back of the workshop could open and close on the model, but the one that was painted ended up getting stuck.",

      "Title": "Hoop House",
      "BodyContent": "The Hoop House was the second stage of the Fall '17 semester, following the hanging garden project and preceding the Grow Center project. The hoop house was thinking at the scale of a greenhouse, which needed to provide life support for plants over the harsh Pittsburgh winter. Our group consisted of six members of diverse backgrounds, from design to construction. The Hoop House was made of steel conduit and greenhouse heat shrink, and was installed at Phipps Conservatory. We're fortunate that our site was just down the road, about a 5 minute walk through a park.\n<br><br>\nMy role in the project was to analyze the site conditions like the standard sun path, temperature, and humidity using Climate Consultant, as well as making a drone-scanned-style model of the site (I don't have a drone so I cheated a bit and used Google Earth). Relating to the work with sunpath, I made a Grasshopper script that displays the sun path and models surfaces based off those sun angles. As the project developed, I made construction axos and really pushed for expression through joinery, which I see as my largest contribution to the project. I assisted Sean in making full-scale working joinery mock-ups. I also got to play the role of fabricator's advocate. Our group had some fantastic designers and strong wills, and I made that our final design could be fabricated and ideally had some truly beautiful movement and joinery. At the end of the day, we were limited to electrical conduit and greenhouse plastic so there was plenty of opportunities to get creative! One final role I played was that I made a documentation video of our project with my GoPro hung off of a shelf in the ceiling.\n<br><br>\nFor a project with so many moving parts and small openings, it was one of the few that didn't fall apart or tear open when I went back to visit after winter break, and of the other greenhouses that remained intact it also kept about half of the plants alive. By that point, most of the other greenhouses had fallen down or had tears in the greenhouse plastic. The skills I learned working with conduit would be something I'd keep with me, coming into play years later with my Safety Stand project. I think this project alone helped me find my place as someone fascinated with fabrication.",
