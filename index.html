                    <b>My Story</b>
                    <p>
                        My journey into making began not in a traditional classroom, but in a workshop where I felt more
                        at home. As a student in architecture school, I realized early on that the conventional academic
                        path wasn’t my calling. However, I found value in the skills I was learning, especially those
                        related to craftsmanship. More importantly, I discovered the true power of hands-on learning in
                        an interdisciplinary makerspace, where people from all backgrounds and fields came together to
                        explore and create. It was there that I recognized how transformative access to a creative space
                        could be for anyone.<br /><br />

                        In my teaching experience, I’ve had the privilege of guiding individuals through their first
                        experiences with technology, from laser cutting to sewing and coding. Yet, the phrase I heard
                        most often from these newcomers was always the same: "I wish I had found this earlier." This
                        moment always reminded me of the untapped potential waiting to be unlocked in every person. I
                        made it my mission to ensure that no one would have to wait to experience the joy and
                        empowerment that comes with making.<br /><br />

                        Through teaching, improving makerspaces, and connecting with others in the field, I’ve come to
                        understand that creating a supportive, accessible environment for creativity is just as
                        important as providing the right tools. Everyone should have access to the resources they need
                        to create—and I want to be part of making that happen.

                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hi there! I’m Kevin Thies — a maker, teacher, gamer, and storyteller who loves turning
                            creative sparks into tangible creations. Whether it’s building props for LARP, designing
                            magical girl TTRPGs, or crafting custom resin dice, I’m always chasing the joy of creating
                            and sharing that joy with others.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When I’m not in a makerspace wielding my trusty heat gun or running a laser cutter, you’ll probably
                            find me at a digital tabletop surrounded by dice, maps, and friends. I’m a passionate TTRPG
                            enthusiast currently in three campaigns (yes, three!), exploring systems like Pathfinder 2e,
                            CAIN, and Lancer. On top of that, I’m the founder and head designer of Mahou Showdown, where
                            I release original games inspired by my favorite anime, Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Making
                            one Magical Girl TTRPG a year has become a tradition, and if you’re curious, you can check
                            them out on my Itch.io page on the left!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Speaking of storytelling, I also love live-action roleplaying (LARP). It’s like combining
                            theater and improvisation with the thrill of adventure — dressing up, running through the
                            woods, and clashing foam swords with friends. My background in film and theater acting makes
                            it a natural fit, and I’ve even run cosplay workshops (ironically, as someone who doesn’t
                            cosplay much).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Making has always been at the core of what I do. During college, every gift I gave was
                            handmade — there’s something special about creating something personal for someone else.
                            Digital fabrication tools like laser cutters are my go-to for quick iteration and
                            high-quality results.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And because I can’t resist a fun challenge, I once ventured into streaming. Inspired by the
                            rise of VTubers, I took to the digital stage to learn about video editing, marketing, and
                            online creativity. Those lessons continue to shape how I present my projects and ideas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Through it all, my goal is simple: to explore, create, and inspire others to do the same. If
                            any of this sounds like your kind of thing, feel free to reach out or explore my portfolio!
