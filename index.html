                    <b>My Story</b>
                    <p>
                        My journey into making began not in a traditional classroom, but in a workshop where I felt more
                        at home. As a student in architecture school, I realized early on that the conventional academic
                        path wasn’t my calling. However, I found value in the skills I was learning, especially those
                        related to craftsmanship. More importantly, I discovered the true power of hands-on learning in
                        an interdisciplinary makerspace, where people from all backgrounds and fields came together to
                        explore and create. It was there that I recognized how transformative access to a creative space
                        could be for anyone.<br /><br />

                        In my teaching experience, I’ve had the privilege of guiding individuals through their first
                        experiences with technology, from laser cutting to sewing and coding. Yet, the phrase I heard
                        most often from these newcomers was always the same: "I wish I had found this earlier." This
                        moment always reminded me of the untapped potential waiting to be unlocked in every person. I
                        made it my mission to ensure that no one would have to wait to experience the joy and
                        empowerment that comes with making.<br /><br />

                        Through teaching, improving makerspaces, and connecting with others in the field, I’ve come to
                        understand that creating a supportive, accessible environment for creativity is just as
                        important as providing the right tools. Everyone should have access to the resources they need
                        to create—and I want to be part of making that happen.
